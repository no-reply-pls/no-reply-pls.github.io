what we'd want each one of all the debugger standard one\",\n        \"So this way, it should add the visible\",\n        \"And we're pretty raw, there will be find out notionally, the code, it's

what we'd want each one of all the debugger standard one\",\n        \"So this way, it should add the visible\",\n        \"And we're pretty raw, there will be find out notionally, the code, it's

when the mindset off chaining [INAUDIBLE] out of the same index HTML elements\",\n        \"Views\",\n        \"Yeah\",\n        \"So I'm going to createRoutes, wee, clearRoutes equals static\",\n
